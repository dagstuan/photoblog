			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				I am an amateur photographer currently residing in Trondheim, Norway. I mostly 	
				just bring my camera around for fun, and since my flickr-account started 
				filling up with random photographs, this website is more of a portfolio of my 
				good work.
			</p>
			<h2>This page</h2>
			<p>This page is written from scratch in Python, using the Django framework. It is 
			   open source, and the source code can be found
